				The original arcade Donkey Kong game was created when Shigeru Miyamoto was assigned by Nintendo to
				convert Radar Scope, a game that had been released to test audiences with poor results, into a game that
				would appeal more to Americans. The result was a major breakthrough for Nintendo and for the videogame
				industry. Sales of the machine were brisk, with the game becoming one of the best-selling arcade
				machines of the early 1980s alongside Pac-Man and Galaga. The gameplay itself was a large improvement
				over other games of its time, and with the growing base of arcades to sell to, it was able to gain huge
				distribution. In the game, 'Jumpman' (the character later became Mario) must ascend a construction site
				while avoiding obstacles such as barrels and fireballs to rescue Pauline, his girlfriend, from Donkey
				Kong. Miyamoto created a greatly simplified version for the Game & Watch multiscreen. Other ports
				include the Atari 2600, Colecovision, Amiga 500, Apple II, Atari 7800, Intellivision, Commodore 64,
				Commodore VIC-20, Famicom Disk System, IBM PC, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, MSX, Atari 8-bit family and
				Mini-Arcade versions. The game was ported to the Family Computer in 1983 as one of the system's three
				launch titles; the same version was a launch title for the Famicom's North American version, the
				Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Both Donkey Kong and its sequel, Donkey Kong Jr., are included in
				the 1988 NES compilation Donkey Kong Classics. The NES version was re-released as an unlockable game in
				Donkey Kong 64 for the Nintendo 64, Animal Crossing for the GameCube[citation needed] and as an item for
				purchase on the Wii's Virtual Console.[4] The original arcade version of the game appears in the
				Nintendo 64 game Donkey Kong 64. Nintendo released the NES version on the e-Reader and for the Game Boy
				Advance Classic NES series in 2002 and 2004, respectively. The game was once more ported to Nintendo
				consoles Wii, Wii U and 3DS in 2013 and 2014, under the name Donkey Kong Original Edition
